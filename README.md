Exercise Personal Website - HTML  Your ultimate task is to create a fully functional Personal Website (PW). The PW has three pages:  Home page. The home page consists of: Heading with your tagline A photo of you and short description List of academic experience List of hobbies Blog page. The blog page includes a list of posts. Each post has a title, date, category and content. Content may include text, images, videos organized in one or more sections. Create at least 3-4 different variations. You can use real-world posts. Blog page also has a search field for searching posts and a dropdown for selecting category. Contact page. The contact page has two sections: A short call-to-action: why someone should contact you. A form for contacting you. The form should have, at least, Name*, Email*, Message* fields. All pages have  a header (title of the page + navigation menu) a footer (copyright info) Since current PW is a static website, you have to hardcode every information. Try to use semantically correct HTML!  Exercise Personal Website - CSS  Style your PW.  Fonts  Use Open Sans from Google Fonts for every text. Define font size / line height / font weight for each text element. Font color should be #222222.  Links  Links should be purple (find your own variance). On hover they should become black.  Layout  The PW should be full-width and have background color of white.  Header is 80px height and has the Title aligned on the left with a 20px left margin and Navigation on the right. Choose a combination of background - text colors. (You can either keep the dark fonts and choose a light(but not white) background or the opposite).  Footer is 80px height and has the text aligned to center. Background-color is the same as the rest website, but has a border of 1px on the top.  Home Page  The Tagline section is full-screen with the text aligned to center both horizontally and vertically. The rest sections have maximum width 60% of the screen size, are center-aligned and have text-align: justify.  Use Flexbox!
